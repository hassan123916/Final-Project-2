# Final-Project-2
This project implements a simple ATM system that allows users to withdraw, deposit, and check their account balance. It also includes a transaction history feature and a currency converter with predefined exchange rates for USD, EUR, and GBP. The system ensures secure access through PIN validation and logs all transactions with timestamps.
